# PiHole-Ticker-RHHD
RainbowHAT-HD News ticker style readout for PiHole

I found some old Python 2 code for the e-ink displays just as I was beginning to both set up a PiHole server and learn Python.
Fast forward a few months and now it's suddenly a Pimoroni RainbowHAT-HD, because I'm way worse with money than Python.
I'm sure this code is an absolute mess, if you can offer suggestions to streamline it they're welcome.
I'd prefer to keep the AI ChatBot's hands off my code though, let's do this like it's 1985. 

My first Python3 project, my first time on GitHub. Go easy on me.

Updating the e-ink display data too, but I still need to learn a few basics on how the old versions worked before I can post it up.

If I missed a contributor to the old codebase, it's just an artifact of me not knowing my way around- let me know what to fix, and how if you don't mind.

Lightly Trek themed; can't say I'm a fan, this was a request from a friend. Set it up to be easy to re-theme.
